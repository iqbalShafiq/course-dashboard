# Course Dashboard
A simple dashboard project designed to learn the basics of using Django Admin and task queues with Huey. This project also includes deploying a Django application to a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Features
-  **Courses**: List, create, and edit courses.

	- Teachers and schedule times are randomly assigned.
	- Each course can have only one schedule.

## Technical Details
